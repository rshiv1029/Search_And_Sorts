# Selection Sort

Here we are implementing a Selection Sort.

Selection Sort is a sorting algorithm that works by finding the minimum value each iteration and adding it to the beginning of the array.

Due to the nested loops, the time complexity is O(n^2) as it is forced to find the minimum every element and add to the beginning of the subarray even if it is sorted.
