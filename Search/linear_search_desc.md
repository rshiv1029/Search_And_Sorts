# Linear Search

Here we are implementing a linear search that returns the index of the target

Linear search takes a list and target value. It will force itself through
the list until it reaches the end. If it comes across the target value it
will return a boolean and the index

This algorithm runs in O(n) as we are going through each element. Thus this
algorithm's time complexity will increase linearly as the size increases.
